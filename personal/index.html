			Hello!! Welcome to my website, I’m Elsa Lin from NTHU, you can also call me Shu-Wei, a Taiwanese and a millenial.
			</p> 
			<p> In my leisure time, I like to sing, watch movies and play volleyball. However, that is just some of my hobby, because I am a person who is full of curiosity of many things. “Going into the unknown” is what I like to do. I think you got it. :D

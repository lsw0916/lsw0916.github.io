				About Shu-Wei
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hello!! Welcome to my website, I’m Elsa Lin from NTHU, you can also call me Shu-Wei, I'm a Taiwanese as well as a millenial.
			</p> 
			<p> 
				In my leisure time, I like to sing, watch movies as well as comics and play volleyball. However, that is just some of my hobby, because I am a person who is full of curiosity of many things. “Going into the unknown” is what I like to do. I think you got it. :D Into the UN~KNOWNNNNN~ (with snowflacks floating down in the air)

				It's the semester of 2021 fall now that I'm already a junior on campus.
				When seeing freshmen walking every where in school with friends and roomates, I sometimes feel a litte bit sad that I just can't believe that I am going to leave school in two years!!(hehe, if no accident)  Time really flies. Nonetheless, I still adopt a positive attitude towards the future; even I have no friends after entering into workplace, I still have my family.<3 Luv'em.
